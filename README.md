**ProgMapper**

ProgMapper is a MacOS utility for music performers which converts MIDI Program Change messages to Control Change messages and outputs them to a virtual MIDI port named "ProgMapperOut".

This is useful in the following cases:

You have a MIDI controller which can send only Program Change messages.
Your want to add a second guitar equipped with a MIDI foot controller to an application like MainStage and emulate preset changing via channel strips muting.
Your sequencer supports only Control Change messages to switch presets or tracks.
